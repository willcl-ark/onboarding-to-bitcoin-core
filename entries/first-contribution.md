# Quickstart: first contribution

{% include best-way.md %}

This guide is for developers who want to quickly begin contributing
to Bitcoin Core but don't know what to work on or how to get started.

- Find an [entry point](/starting-ideas.html) such as a bug an
  established contributor has tagged as a "good first issue".

  - You may want to quickly [mention](/comms.html) your planned approach
    in chat to confirm established contributors agree that it's a good
    direction.

  - Note on the issue, PR, or other page that you're working on the
    problem so others don't duplicate your work.

- To address an issue:

  - You will need to [build Bitcoin
    Core](/building.html) optionally with [debugging
    options](/debugging.html).

  - You may want to [write a test](/testing.html) that demonstrates your
    bug and will prove it's been fixed.

  - If you need certain network activity to reproduce your bug, you can
    test on [test networks](/testnets.html).

  - If you're trying to find a particular file, learn about Bitcoin
    Core's [architecture](/architecture.html).

  - If you encounter confusing code, research the [history of that
    particular code](/past-changes.html).

- To contribute a change:

  - Follow project [guidelines](/contributing.html) for effective
    commits and GitHub PRs.

  - Understand the jargon and process other developers will use in
    [evaluating](/pr-maturation.html) your proposed change.

  - Optionally help [review](/reviewing.html) contributions from other
    developers to encourage them to review your contribution.

Many other parts of the contributing guide can help explain how to
successfully make your first contribution.  If you find yourself stymied
at any point, or just curious about Bitcoin Core, please consider
reading the full documentation starting from the [main page](/).
