|===

Bitcoin Core is also introducing (functional) "stress tests" which challenge the program via interruptions and missing files to ensure that we fail gracefully, e.g. the tests introduced in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23289[PR#23289^].

=== Test directory structure

The following diagram gives a brief overview of how the tests are structured within the source directory.

WARNING: This diagram is **not** exhaustive and includes simplifications.

NOTE: dashed lines indicate optional components

NOTE: The `fuzz_targets` themselves are located in the `test` folder, however the fuzz tests are run via the `test_runner` in src/test so we point fuzz to there.

NOTE: `qa_assets` are found in a https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets[separate^] repo altogether, as they are quite large (~3.5GB repo size and ~13.4GB on clone).
